This repository hosts SQL code dedicated to exploring COVID-19 data. It demonstrates various SQL techniques for gaining insights and conducting analysis on COVID-19 data. The code in this repository effectively leverages SQL techniques such as joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), temporary tables, window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and data type conversions to provide comprehensive insights into COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination data. I analyzed this data on Google Cloud SQL; data importing was so much easier than any other import-export wizard.
